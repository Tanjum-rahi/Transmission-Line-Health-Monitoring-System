# Transmission-Line-Health-Monitoring-System
This paper presents a real-time fault detection and classification framework for transmission lines that integrates MATLAB Simulink simulation with machine learning and a web-based dashboard. A detailed Simulink model generates three-phase voltage and current data under various fault and normal conditions. Among several evaluated algorithms—including SVM, DT Random Forest, and k-NN—an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) achieved superior performance with 99.9% accuracy. This optimized ANN model was embedded directly into the Simulink environment for real-time, in-simulation monitoring. The system automatically logs fault events to a MySQL database and features an interactive dashboard built with Dash and Plotly for visualization and analytics. The results demonstrate a robust, end-to-end solution that enhances fault management and operational reliability in smart grids.
